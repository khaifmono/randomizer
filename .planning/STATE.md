# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Satisfying, animated randomization that feels fun to use — the wheel spins smoothly, dice tumble, coins flip with personality.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: 1 (complete)
Status: Executing

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Client-side only — all randomization logic runs in the browser, no API calls
- Init: localStorage for wheel item persistence — simple cross-session persistence without auth/backend
- Init: Standard 6-sided dice only for v1 — keeps scope focused
- Init: Use `motion@^12.37.0` for wheel spin deceleration (NOT the old `framer-motion` package name)
- Init: HTML5 Canvas for wheel rendering — correct primitive for dynamic segment count and 60fps rotation
- Init: Pre-determine winner before animation starts — prevents angle mismatch bugs
- [Phase 01-02]: Named export RandomizerPage alongside Route export to enable direct unit testing without router context
- [Phase 01-02]: Manually updated routeTree.gen.ts with /randomizer route since Vite plugin only auto-regenerates on dev server start
- [Phase 02-spinning-wheel]: itemsRef pattern: useRef mirrors useState so callbacks in useWheel always access latest items without stale closure
- [Phase 02-spinning-wheel]: originalItemsRef initialized via readStorage directly (not from useState initial value) to avoid initialization order issues
- [Phase 02-spinning-wheel]: onSpinEnd does NOT update originalItemsRef — only user-initiated add/remove do, so reset() can restore all spin-removed items
