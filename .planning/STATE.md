# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Client-side only — all randomization logic runs in the browser, no API calls
- Init: localStorage for wheel item persistence — simple cross-session persistence without auth/backend
- Init: Standard 6-sided dice only for v1 — keeps scope focused
- Init: Use `motion@^12.37.0` for wheel spin deceleration (NOT the old `framer-motion` package name)
- Init: HTML5 Canvas for wheel rendering — correct primitive for dynamic segment count and 60fps rotation
- Init: Pre-determine winner before animation starts — prevents angle mismatch bugs
