# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Client-side only — all randomization logic runs in the browser, no API calls
- Init: localStorage for wheel item persistence — simple cross-session persistence without auth/backend
- Init: Standard 6-sided dice only for v1 — keeps scope focused
- Init: Use `motion@^12.37.0` for wheel spin deceleration (NOT the old `framer-motion` package name)
- Init: HTML5 Canvas for wheel rendering — correct primitive for dynamic segment count and 60fps rotation
- Init: Pre-determine winner before animation starts — prevents angle mismatch bugs
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Shadcn Tabs @/ alias issue: manually copy to src/ and fix import to @base-project/web/ per project convention
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Accent color tokens use direct oklch values in @theme inline (not CSS variable indirection) since they are new additive colors not participating in dark-mode theming
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Shadcn generated Tabs already includes line variant via CVA on TabsList - no manual augmentation needed
